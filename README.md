# mnist_pytorch_tensorflow
A simple neural network and a CNN applied on the MNIST dataset.
This notebook gives two examples of neural networks: a simple, feedforward, fully connected network with a hidden layer, very similar to a multilayer perceptron built using Pytorch and a more complex convolutional neural network with 7 layers, based on Tensorflow and Keras.

Because a CNN is more complex and therefore slower, using a GPU is recommendend.
